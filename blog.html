          <h1 class="center">Google working on satellite communication support for Android 14 phones</h1>  
          <p id="para1">Spacecraft engineering company SpaceX and T-Mobile recently announced a partnership that will enable smartphones to connect directly to satellites.

            According to GSM Arena, this will be supported by upcoming Starlink V2 satellites but will work with existing phones because it will use an existing band in the PCS spectrum.
            
            Google SVP of Platforms & Ecosystems Hiroshi Lockheimer announced on Twitter that the company is working on building satellite communication support into the next version of Android (v14).</p>
